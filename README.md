# _Wildlife_tracker_

#### _this application allows you to store animals that you have sighted into a database. 10/1/16_

#### By _**Jackson Meyer**_

## Description

_This application features two forms, one for entering endangered animals and one for entering the sighting.  The purpose of this application is to track animals out in the field, this simulates a ranger doing field work and making sure that there is a small enough population for endangered animals so that it is okayed that a logging company can clear-cut. Beyond that, it is meant to to show that I have a grasp of advanced java concepts we have learned this last week at Epicodus. We are focused on database entry, inheritance, testing, and pSQL navigation_
